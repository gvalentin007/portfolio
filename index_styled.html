		<h1>My Geography 485L/585L Home Page</h1>
		<span style="font-weight:bold">About me</span>
		<p>My name is Gladys Valentin. I am a on my second year as a graduate student at the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies, UNM, majoring in GIScience. My masters thesis deals with assessing vegetation response to fire frequency and fire severity in Bandelier National Monument through Remote Sensing and GIS.

		<span style="font-weight:bold">Why I'm taking the course</span> 
		<p>While doing research for my thesis, I stumbled upon a <a href="http://www.geo.mtu.edu/rs4hazards/ksdurst/website/">website</a> created by a graduate student, where she shared content related to her masters thesis. I was inspired to learn more about creating a personal website/online portfolio where I could share my academic work. Through the first couple of lectures and lab exercises I've been able to learn the basics of creating and styling a webpage, and I look forward to developing more skills througout the semester.
