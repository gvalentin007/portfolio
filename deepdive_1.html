		<h1>Sub-aerial Beach Inventory of Puerto Rico</h1>
				
		<p><a href="index_styled.html">Home</a></p>
		
		<p> Sub-aerial beaches are defined as deposits of unconsolidated sediments, including sand or gravel, extending from permanent physiographic features <br>
		landward (vegetation, dunes and/or man-made structures)	to the high water level. This map presents a the sub-aerial beach inventory <br>
		I created during my undergraduate studies at the University of Puerto Rico, using ArcGIS 10.1 through interpretation of high-resulotuion imagery collected in 2010. <br>
		Characteristics such as beach area, length, presence of beachrock and other barriers, river mouths, and adjacent structures were added to the attribute table. <br>
		Results showed that ArcGIS succeeded as a tool for coastal studies of this nature, allowing designing and executing a comprehensive inventory, based on features <br>
		and their multiple attributes. A total of 1,225 sub-aerial beaches were identified in Puerto Rico mainland, Vieques and Culebra island-municipalities, <br>
		and Caja de Muertos Island. This beach inventory represents the first detailed geographic database of beaches in Puerto Rico, which can be updated and <br>
		could serve to monitor morphological changes and data relevant to coastal studies.
		</p>
		
		<p> I chose to display this shapefile for our Deep Dive 1 to learn how to integrate spatial data using Google Fusion Tables <br>
		on Google API maps. In this map I used a hybrid basemap, so that the audience can visualize the beach systems through the satellite image, <br>
		and also be able to see the road network and places of interest near them. This map also includes the markers created for <a href="map_m4.html">Milestone 4</a> <br>
		to show some of the best beaches in the Island vis a vis beach boundaries. 
		</p>
		
		<p> <b> Note that </b> the digitization of beach structures was based on the interpretation of imagery that is not the one displayed in this map. <br>
		Thus, the beach polygons may not coincide with the imagery or basemaps provided in the map, and may appear to be misplaced.
