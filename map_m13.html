		<h2>Milestone 13</h2>
		<h1>Fire History in Northern New Mexico</h1>
		<h2>Closeness of fire occurrence to human settlements and critical infrastructure</h2>
		<p><a href="index_styled.html">Home</a></p>
		
		<p> Wildfires in the United Sates' southwest region are a common phenomena that, in the past couple of decades, <br>
		have made headlines for their impacts on human settlements/developments, as well as effects on the natural <br>
		environment. Post-fire flash flood and mass movement events, prompted by the creation of impervious soils <br>
		by the fires, bring a new load fo materials (soil, rocks, woody debris) down stream, which can pose a threat <br>
		to buildings and transportation infrastructure. 
		</p>
		
		<p> The goal of the map below is to help visualize the closeness and intersection of fire boundaries to <br>
		populated areas, including Native Ameican Reservations, a well as roads and bridges in northern New Mexico.<br>
		Th map contains a set of layers obtained from the New Mexico Resource Geographic Information System (RGIS), <br>
		and include the following: (1) fire history in the form of fire perimeters, (2) Native-American reservation areas, <br>
		(3) populated areas and (4) bridges that intersect with fire permeters, and (5) New Mexico counties.
		</p>
		
		<p> It is important to know that, due to the lack of information about the year bridges/culverts were constructed, the <br>
		the bridge/culvert subset does not consider wether they were there when the fire(s) occurred. This means that <br>
		some bridges/culverts may have been constructed after the overlapping fire occurred. Thus, the bridges/culverts <br>
		included in the map represent ones that were constructed in areas burned bu fires, that were (potentially) affected <br>
		by fire heat, or might have been closed due to closeness to fire, affecting transit in the area. 
		</p>
			
		<p> You can zoom out to view the data presented for all of New Mexico.
