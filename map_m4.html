		<h2>Milestone 4</h2>
		<h1>Best Beaches in Puerto Rico</h1>
		
		<p><a href="index_styled.html">Home</a></p>
		
		<p> For this milestone, I got a chance to play with the style options provided by the <a href="https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/">Google Maps APIs Styling Wizard</a>. <br>
		Although for the concept that this milestone follows a satellite image is best for background, you can view the style changes <br>
		I made by clicking in &quotMap&quot. Changes include color of the sea, natural and developed areas, natural parks and streets.
