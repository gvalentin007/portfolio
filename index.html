		<h1>My Geography 485L/585L Home Page</h1>
		<p>About me: <br>My name is Gladys Valentin. I am a on my second year as graduate student at the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies, UNM, majoring in GIScience. My masters thesis deals with assessing vegetation response to the Las Conchas fire in Bandleier National Monument through Remote Sensing and GIS.
		</p>
		
		<p>Why I'm taking the course to learn how to share geospatial content on the web. While doing research for my thesis, I stumbled upon a <a href="http://www.geo.mtu.edu/rs4hazards/ksdurst/website/">website</a> created by a graduate student, where she shared content related to her masters thesis. I was inspired to learn more about creating a website to share my academic work. </p>
